User context propagation (X-User-ID headers)
Service Discovery & Config:

Dynamic service discovery via Eureka
Centralized config server for all microservices
Environment-specific configurations

ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS & CONCEPTS IMPLEMENTED
Microservices Architecture - Independent, scalable services
Event-Driven Architecture - RabbitMQ for async activity processing
API Gateway Pattern - Spring Cloud Gateway as single entry point
Service Discovery Pattern - Eureka for dynamic service registration
Centralized Configuration - Spring Cloud Config Server
OAuth2 Security - PKCE flow with Keycloak
Reactive Programming - Spring WebFlux for non-blocking I/O
Database per Service - MongoDB & PostgreSQL segregation
Message Queue Pattern - RabbitMQ for decoupled services
DTO Pattern - Request/Response objects for API contracts

API ENDPOINTS & OPERATIONS
Activity Service:

POST /api/activities - Track new activity
GET /api/activities - Get user's all activities
GET /api/activities/{activityId} - Get specific activity details
Recommendation Service:

Get user recommendations
Get activity-specific recommendations
User Service:

POST /api/users/register - User registration
GET /api/users/profile/{userId} - Get user profile
User validation endpoints

FRONTEND COMPONENTS & PAGES
React Components:

ActivityForme.jsx - Form to add new activities (Type, Duration, Calories)
ActivityList.jsx - Display user's activity history
ActivityDetail.jsx - Detailed view of individual activities
App.jsx - Main app with routing, authentication handling

Features:

OAuth2 PKCE authentication flow
Token management (localStorage)
User ID handling across requests
Material-UI form components
Activity type selection (dropdown)
Real-time form submission with error handling

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS
Code Quality & Best Practices:

Lombok annotations for reducing boilerplate
Reactive WebFlux for async operations
Comprehensive error handling & logging
Configuration externalization
REST API design principles
Request validation
JSON serialization/deserialization
Integration & Communication:

REST APIs between services
RabbitMQ asynchronous message processing
OAuth2 token-based authentication
Service-to-service communication via Eureka
Data Management:

MongoDB for flexible NoSQL storage (Activities, Recommendations)
PostgreSQL for structured relational data (Users)
Data models with timestamps (CreatedDate, UpdatedDate)
Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for API contracts

PROJECT COMPLEXITY & SCALE
