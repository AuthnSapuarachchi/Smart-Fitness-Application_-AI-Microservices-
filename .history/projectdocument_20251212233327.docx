ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS & CONCEPTS IMPLEMENTED
Microservices Architecture - Independent, scalable services
Event-Driven Architecture - RabbitMQ for async activity processing
API Gateway Pattern - Spring Cloud Gateway as single entry point
Service Discovery Pattern - Eureka for dynamic service registration
Centralized Configuration - Spring Cloud Config Server
OAuth2 Security - PKCE flow with Keycloak
Reactive Programming - Spring WebFlux for non-blocking I/O
Database per Service - MongoDB & PostgreSQL segregation
Message Queue Pattern - RabbitMQ for decoupled services
DTO Pattern - Request/Response objects for API contracts

API ENDPOINTS & OPERATIONS
Activity Service:

POST /api/activities - Track new activity
GET /api/activities - Get user's all activities
GET /api/activities/{activityId} - Get specific activity details
Recommendation Service:

Get user recommendations
Get activity-specific recommendations
User Service:

POST /api/users/register - User registration
GET /api/users/profile/{userId} - Get user profile
User validation endpoints
